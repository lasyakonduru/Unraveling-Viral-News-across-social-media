Viral News Dynamics: A Multi-Factor Analysis of Article Popularity on Social Media

•	Which news article characteristics make them viral across different social media?
•	Is there any topic that makes some news more viral than others across different social media and changes over time?
•	How does user sentiment in using likes, shares, and comments predict the popularity of news articles?

Question 2: Is there any topic that makes some news more viral than others across different social media and changes over time?
What has been done:
Topic Modeling:

Used LDA to identify dominant topics in the dataset and assigned topics to articles.
Identified which topics received the highest average engagement across platforms.
Engagement Trends by Topic:

Visualized engagement trends over time (e.g., Facebook engagement for "economy" and other topics).
What should be done next:
Analyze Topic-Specific Engagement:

Explore engagement patterns across platforms (Facebook, GooglePlus, LinkedIn) for each topic.
Compare topics with high engagement over time to identify consistent or emerging trends.
Topic-Sentiment Interaction:

Examine how sentiment interacts with topics to drive engagement. For instance, are certain topics more viral when presented positively vs. negatively?

Question 3: How does user sentiment in using likes, shares, and comments predict the popularity of news articles?
What has been done:
Sentiment-Engagement Correlation:
Calculated and visualized the correlation between sentiment scores (BERT_Score) and engagement metrics.
Found that engagement generally correlates with sentiment but may vary by platform.
What should be done next:
Sentiment and Platform-Specific Analysis:

Analyze how sentiment scores drive engagement differently on platforms (e.g., positive sentiment may perform better on Facebook, while neutral scores may do well on LinkedIn).
Compare sentiment-driven engagement for specific topics (e.g., "economy" vs. "microsoft").
Predictive Modeling:

Build a predictive model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict total engagement (Facebook + GooglePlus + LinkedIn) based on SentimentTitle, Topic, and other features.


Summary:
The characteristics that make news articles viral are:

Topical relevance, focusing on high-profile figures and globally significant themes.
Concise and impactful headlines, featuring strong, emotional keywords.
Emotionally resonant sentiment, where negative sentiment leads on platforms like Facebook, and positive sentiment thrives on LinkedIn.
Platform-specific tailoring, acknowledging Facebook’s dominance in emotional content and LinkedIn’s preference for professional news.
Cluster alignment, where articles fit into well-defined themes such as politics, technology, or economy.
These insights align with findings from Kilgo & Sinta (2016) on sensationalistic headlines and Sangiorgio et al. (2024) on platform dynamics in news virality.
