# 📊 Unraveling Viral News: Decoding the Dynamics of Social Media Engagement and Article Popularity

Welcome to the repository for **Unraveling Viral News** — a data-driven exploration into the factors that make news articles go viral across social media platforms. This project was developed as part of my final School assignment at **Saint Louis University** under the guidance of **Professor Ravindranth Arunasalam**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With social media shaping the way we consume information, understanding **why some articles attract massive engagement while others do not** has become critical. This project aims to:
- Analyze **platform-specific trends** (Facebook, LinkedIn, GooglePlus).
- Explore the impact of **sentiment, topics, hashtags, mentions, and sources** on article engagement.
- Build **predictive models** to identify characteristics that make content viral.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔍 Data Analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: BERT-based sentiment scoring for titles and headlines.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Analysis of likes, shares, comments, hashtags, and mentions.
- **Platform Trends**: Comparison of engagement across Facebook, LinkedIn, and GooglePlus.

### 📚 Topic Modeling
- Leveraged **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and clustering techniques to identify trending topics.
- Explored **word frequency, bigrams, and trigrams** to understand headline patterns.

### 📈 Predictive Modeling
- Built **Random Forest** and **Polynomial Regression** models to predict engagement.
- Evaluated feature importance to identify the most impactful article characteristics.

### 📅 Time-Based Analysis
- Studied how headline characteristics and engagement trends evolved over time.
- Focused on key events like the 2016 elections.

## 💡 Research Questions

1. **Which news article characteristics make them viral across different social media?**
2. **Is there any topic that makes some news more viral than others across platforms and changes over time?**
3. **How does user sentiment in using likes, shares, and comments predict the popularity of news articles?**

## 📊 Key Insights

- Articles with **positive or neutral sentiment** tend to perform better across platforms.
- Certain topics (e.g., "Obama," "Economy") consistently attract higher engagement.
- **Hashtags and mentions** significantly influence virality, with trending keywords amplifying reach.
- **Headline patterns**, such as the use of numbers ("Top 10") and emotional words, play a critical role in driving engagement.
